1. Create the possibility that the players and the game should be able 
to handle groups of characters (composite)
- multiple players or NPCs (non player characters - BOTS) can be grouped together
- groups can grow by including other groups or individual characters
- some characters can control groups
(COMPOOSITE => hierarchy of groups and characters)
