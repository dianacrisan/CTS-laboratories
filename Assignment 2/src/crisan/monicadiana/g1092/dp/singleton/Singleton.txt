Bachelor Project: Web Application for Data Mining

Where can SINGLETON be implemented:
The singleton pattern allows a class or an object to have a single instance and
it a global variable would be used in order to manage that instance. This prevents 
multiple instances of that class to be active at the same time. 
Because for my web application I use React components for my front-end, I believe 
that this pattern may be good for logging errors from all of the different parts 
of the applications during the debugging process.

Advantages:
- logger class instantiated only once and global access to that instance
- easy to implement and easy to use
- lazy instantiation
- don't have to deal with synchronization (writing to data files)

Disadvantages:
- code lines must be inspected carefully so that we understand what the methods 
are actually doing
- the singleton implementation does not follow the DRY principle
