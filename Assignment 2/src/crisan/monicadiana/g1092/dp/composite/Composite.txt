Bachelor Project: Web Application for Data Mining

Where can COMPOSITE be implemented:
Because the web application allows users to create projects where various data files 
that will be used as data for the data analysis steps may be added, i think that this 
patter can expose the hierarchical structure of this process.


Advantages:
- flexibility and simple extendibility
- integration of new leaf nodes without code modifications

Disadvantages:
- hard to modify the general structure of the hierarchy
