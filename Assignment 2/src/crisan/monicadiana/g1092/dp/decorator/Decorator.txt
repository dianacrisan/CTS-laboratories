Bachelor Project: Web Application for Data Mining

Where can DECORATOR be implemented:
The decorator pattern may be used inside my web application for example when decorating 
a special page after the main page (for example with different media elements) or simply when 
creating a special user like a manager after the default user template.

Advantages:
- easy to implement and understand
- more flexibility to add functionalities to already existing components
- there are no limits to the maximum number of decorations

Disadvantages:
- a decorator is only a wrapper to the initial object and they are not identical
- excessive use may result in a lot of similar objects with different behaviors
