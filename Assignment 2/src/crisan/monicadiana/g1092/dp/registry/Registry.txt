Bachelor Project: Web Application for Data Mining

Where can REGISTRY be implemented:
Similar to the Singleton approach, but when using registry, multiple unique objects are managed 
using a collection, in this case a HashMap. In this case, when wanting to create a new 
logger instance, I first check if the instance exists and then create a new one to store 
it in the HashMap.

Advantages:
- easy implementation
- multiple "associations" of the same class may be created

Disadvantages:
- not only one instance of the singleton is stored in the collection
