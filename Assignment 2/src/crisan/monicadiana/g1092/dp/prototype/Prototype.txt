Bachelor Project: Web Application for Data Mining

Where can PROTOTYPE be implemented:
I believe that I may implement the prototype pattern when wanting to clone certain 
project data files that may be used for data analysis processes. For example, I 
may want to clone a file that I used for regression analysis to use it again for 
principal component analysis.

Advantages:
- easy to detect errors
- flexibility and ease in implementation

Disadvantages:
- complex objects may need another implementation for cloning
