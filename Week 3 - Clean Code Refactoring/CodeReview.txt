Code Review

1. Code structure & naming conventions

- the package name is too generic; where is the module name?
- the class name is not proper
- the function name is too generic
- the function arguments names are not OK
- t and s must have meaningful names

2. Implementation

- too many "magic numbers" (hardcoded values)
- is t limited to {1,2,3,4} or can it be bigger?
- there are no validations for t, s and perioada

3. Single Responsability & KISS

- outsource the intermediary operations into new simple functions
